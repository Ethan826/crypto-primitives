This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I use React to help me learn the library. I now realize that these components
could have held their own state, more like the `Mining` component and
container do. I also need to do something about how unwieldy `actions` and
the single monster `reducer` have become. There are also no tests, though
arguably there's not much value in them as the business logic is basically
all direct calls to library functions.
